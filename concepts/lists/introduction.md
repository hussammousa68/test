# Introduction

A [list][list] is a mutable collection of items in _sequence_.  They're an extremely flexible and useful data structure that many built-in methods and operations in Python produce as output.  Lists can hold reference to any (or multiple) data type(s) - including other lists or data structures such as [tuples][tuples], [sets][sets], or [dicts][dicts]. Content can be iterated over using the `for item in <list>` construct. `Lists` be copied in whole or in part using  _slice notation_ or `<list>.copy()` and elements within can be accessed via `0-based index number`
