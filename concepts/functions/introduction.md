# Introduction

A [`function`][function] is a block of code that takes an input and produces an output. It is used to perform a specific repititive task.  A function can accept `parameters`, do some processing, and then return a value. The parameters and return value can be of any data type and are optional. In python, functions are [_first class objects_][first-class objects], which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as the value of other functions. There are many [_built-in functions_][built-in functions] in python, but you can also create your own functions.
