# Introduction

There are two looping constructs.
`while` loops for _indefinite_ (uncounted) iteration and `for` loops for  _definite_, (counted) iteration.
The keywords `break`, `continue`, and `else` help customize loop behavior.
`range()` and `enumerate()` help with loop counting and indexing.


`while` loops continue to exectute as long as the loop expression or "test" evaluates to `True`, terminating when it evaluates to `False`.

```python
while expression:
    set_of_statements
```

`for` loops cycle through the values of any sequence, terminating when there are no more values returned.

```python
for item in sequence:
    set_of_statements
```
