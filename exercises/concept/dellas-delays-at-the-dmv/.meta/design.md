## üéØ Goal

This `functions` concept exercise is meant to teach a deeper understanding and use of `functions`  in Python. It should also explain how Python treats/views functions (_as callable objects_), and dig into some of the features that make Python `functions` unique.


<br>

## üí°Learning objectives

- Understand more about  Python `scopes` and `namespaces`
  - understand the difference between the `global` and `nonlocal` keywords and when to use them
- Get familiar with the [special attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types) of Python functions
- Get familiar with best practices when using `return`, and the difference between _explicit_ and _implicit_ `return`
   - functions without an explicit return will return the singleton object `None`
- Understand what is meant by _"functions are first class **objects** in Python"_.
  - understand that `functions` **are** `objects` in Python, and that they have `types`
  - understand that `functions` can be assigned to variables, used in expressions,  and stored in various data structures such as `dicts` or `lists`
  - create `functons` that are assigned to variables, used in expressions, and stored in different data structures.
  - understand and create` functions` that are/can be nested inside one another
- Understand that Python considers a function a form of  `callable object`. 
- Understand that a user-defined `function object` is created by a `function definition`.

## ü§î Concepts

- `callable objects`
- `first-class functions`
- `global`
- `nested functions`
- `nonlocal`
- `return`, `implicit return`, `explicit return`
- `scope`
-  special `function attributes`

## üö´ Topics that are Out of scope


<br>
<details>
<summary><b>Concepts & Subjects that are Out of Scope</b> (<em>click to expand</em>)</summary>
<br>

- `named parameters` (_these can be touched on if needed_)
-  `default parameters` (_these can be touched on, if needed_)
- `arbitrary parameters`
- `*args & **kwargs`
- `keyword-only arguments`
- `/` and `*` for requiring parameter types
-  `functions-as-arguments` (_this can be mentioned, but shouldn't be required for the exercise_)
- `functions-as-returns`(_this can be mentioned, but will be covered in-depth in `higher-order functions`)
- `closures` (_these will be covered in a different exercise_)
- `decorators` (_these will be covered in a different exercise_)
-  `functools.wraps` (_this is used mostly for decorators_)
-  `functools` (_this will get its own exercise_)
- `comprehensions`
- `generators`
- `lambda`, `anonymous functions` (_these will be covered in a different exercise_)
- `recursion`

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è  Prerequisites

_These are the concepts/concept exercises the student needs to complete/understand before solving this concept exercise.  Since `functions` is a "meta" topic,  these will probably need to be adjusted to fit the parameters of the exercise._
