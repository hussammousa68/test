# Hints

## General

## 1. Tracking Poker Rounds

- `Lists` in python may be [constructed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list) in several ways.
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list`.

## 2. Keeping all Rounds in the Same Place

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `list`.

## 3. Finding Prior Rounds

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- This function should [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) a `boolean`.

## 4. Averaging Card Values

- There are a few techniques to [iterate over a `list` in python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-a-list-in-python/).
- To get the average, this function should count how many items are in the list and sum up their values. Then, return sum divided by count.

## 5. Alternate Averages

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- To access an element use the square brackets notation.
- Remember that the first element of the `list` is at index 0
- In python, negative indexing starts the count from the end. This mean that you can find the last element of the `list` at index -1.
- Think about reusing the code from the functions that you just implemented.

## 6. More Averaging Techniques

- Sequence types such as `list` already support a few [common operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
- Think about reusing the code from the functions that you just implemented.
- The slice syntax supports a step value.

## 7. Bonus Round Rules

- `Lists` in python are mutable, this means that once a `list` is created, you can modify, delete or add any element as you wish.
- Python provides a wide range of [ways to modify `lists`](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/#lists-are-mutable).
- This function should not [return](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_return.asp) anything so you should end it with just the statement `return`.
