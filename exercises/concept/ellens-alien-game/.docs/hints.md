# Hints

## 1. Create the Alien Class

- Remember that class methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.
- Remember the double underscores on _both_ sides of `__init__`.
- Instance variables are unique to the object/class instance that posesses them.
- Class variables are the same across all instances of a class.

## 2. The `hit` Method

- Remember that class methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.

## 3. The `is_alive` Method

- Remember that class methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.
- 0 is not the only 'dead' condition.

## 4. The `teleport` Method

- Remember that class methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.

## 5. The `collision_detection` Method

- Remember that class methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.
- If you wish to `pass` on completing a method, there is a way.

## 6. Alien Counter

- Class variables are the same across all instances of a class.

## 7. Object Creation

- A tuple is a single parameter.
- Alien takes 2 parameters.
- What you really want is what is inside the tuple.
