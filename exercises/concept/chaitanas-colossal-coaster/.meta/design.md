# Design

## Goal

This concept exercise should make the student aware of the existence of some list methods that allow us to work with lists, and how to use them to modify lists and operate with them.

## Learning objectives

- Understand when it is appropriate to use methods of a list to operate with it
- Understand that a method of a list mutates the list and does not return a new altered list
- Use one or more of the below methods to alter a list:
    - Add a single item to the end of a list with the append() method
    - Remove all items from a list with the clear() method
    - Insert an item in a list with the insert() method
    - Remove the item at the given index with the pop() method
    - Remove an item from a list with the remove() method
    - Reverse a list with the reverse() method
    - Sort items of a list with the sort() method
    - Return a shallow copy of a list with the copy() method
    - Return the number of times an item occurs in a list with the count() method
    - Add all items from another iterable to the end of a list with the extend() method
    - Return the index of an item in a list with the index() method
- Understand which data in a list can be sorted and/or compared
