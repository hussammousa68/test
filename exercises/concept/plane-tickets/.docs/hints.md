# Hints

## 1. Generate an amount of seats

- The returned value should be of _type_ `generator`.
- Row `13` should be skipped, so go from `12` to `14`.
- Keep in mind that the returned values should be ordered from low to high. `1A, 1B, 2A, ...`

## 2. Assign seats to passengers

- Make sure your seat numbers do not have any space in them.
