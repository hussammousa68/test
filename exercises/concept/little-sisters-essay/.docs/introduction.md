Python provides several useful methods that can be used to manipulate strings.
These methods can be used for cleaning, splitting, translating any variable of type `str`.
Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator or with `str.join()`.
Strings also implement all of the common operations for a sequence and can be iterated using the syntax: `for item in <string>`.

`Strings` are immutable, meaning their value in memory cannot change.
It means the standard library methods will return a new instance of `str` instead of modifying the existing `str`.
