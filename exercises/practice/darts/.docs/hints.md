# Hints

## General

-  This challenge is all about calculating if a point falls _on, in, or outside_ a given circle.
-  There are two different ways of calculating if a point falls on, in, or outside a circle: _Stack Overflow_ - [Equation for Testing if a Point is Inside a Circle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/481144/equation-for-testing-if-a-point-is-inside-a-circle) outlines one method.
_DoubleRoot_ - [Position of a point relative to a circle](https://doubleroot.in/lessons/circle/position-of-a-point/) outlines a different one.
- This _Math is Fun_ post covers a more general [Distance Between 2 Points](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html) calculation.
- Because the dart board is a set of _nested_ circles, the order in which you calculate points could change the answer significantly.
  You should pay attention to which direction your calculations "move" in.
-  Remember that this exercise has many potential solutions and many paths you can take along the way.
   No path is manifestly "better" than another, although a particular path may be more interesting or better suited to what you want to learn or explore right now.
-  Some paths may trade speed for clarity.
   Others might take up more memory but be more scalable or maintainable.
-  We encourage you to try out more than one programming strategy to see what happens.
